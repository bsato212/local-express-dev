# Assignment 1
- The local Express development setup currently returns a fixed Hello World string
- Update it to read a name parameter from the query string (GET) and use it in the returned string.
- If no value is found it should default to World.

# Assignment 2
- Using the local Web development setup, build an HTML form that uses the Express server as its target action.
- Add an input field to the form with name and id attributes set to name.
- After the submit button is clicked, the form should send the contents of the input field to the Express server.
